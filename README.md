# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting the risk of loan default using historical loan data. This analysis helps determine whether the model can accurately classify loans as healthy or high-risk, providing valuable insights for financial decision-making.

## Results
- **Accuracy score:** 
- **Precision score:** 
  - Class 0 (Healthy loan): 100% 
  - Class 1 (High-risk loan): 84%
- **Recall score:** 
  - Class 0 (Healthy loan): 99%
  - Class 1 (High-risk loan): 94%

## Summary
The logistic regression model predicts the `0` (healthy loan) label with extremely high precision and recall (both 100%). It also predicts the `1` (high-risk loan) label well, with a precision of 85% and a recall of 91%. Overall, the model has an accuracy of 99%, indicating that it is highly effective in distinguishing between healthy and high-risk loans.
Based on the classification report, the logistic regression model's performance,  the model shows high precision and recall for both classes, it can be recommended for use.  improvements may be needed for class 1 precision  before deployment.
