# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting the risk of loan default using historical loan data. This analysis helps determine whether the model can accurately classify loans as healthy or high-risk, providing valuable insights for financial decision-making.

## Results
- **Accuracy score:** 
- **Precision score:** 
  - Class 0 (Healthy loan): 
  - Class 1 (High-risk loan): 
- **Recall score:** 
  - Class 0 (Healthy loan): 
  - Class 1 (High-risk loan): 

## Summary
Based on the classification report, the logistic regression model's performance is summarized. If the model shows high precision and recall for both classes, it can be recommended for use. Otherwise, improvements may be needed before deployment.
